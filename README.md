- ChatGPT, queries:
  - So I want to draw 3 alphabets character using gl.LINES, can you show me how?
  - I see you colorize the lines in th fragmentShaderSource, can you tell me how to convert hexadecimal value of color to the vec4?
  - so let's go back at that drawing 3 alphabet. Instead of using gl.LINES, can you tell me how to do that using gl.TRIANGLES?
  - Can you show me vertices to draw character U using gl.TRIANGLES?
  - So I want to display both of the gl.LINES and the gl.TRIANGLES. Can you show me how to redraw?
  - Can you show me how to show the gl.LINES for 2 seconds, after that show gl.TRIANGLES for 2 seconds, and then repeat?
  - how to change the canvas background color?

> Reminder that not every ChatGPT answer is actually answered my question, for example the vertices point for drawing the character. Some of the answers doesn't really draw a character
